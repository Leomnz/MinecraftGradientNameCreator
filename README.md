## Instructions
Select two colors using the color pickers. Then type in text to see a live preview. This will generate a hex code and an additional output that minecraft or luckperms uses.

## About The Project
This project uses React with Material UI. In order to find the gradient, we used the RGB values of the two colors and found the unit vector between the two values.

## About the Authors
This project was made by Leo Adams and John Stromberg.
